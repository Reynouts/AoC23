Here we are again! Let's get some stars!
Small gotcha today that *re.findall* does not do overlapping matches, 
but that can be solved with positive lookahead.
## [--- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---](http://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)
Just some 10 minute weekend holiday coding at the Ardennes! 
Nothing fancy.. part 2 was given the way I solved part 1.

## [--- Day 3: Gear Ratios ---](http://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)
No time today, so solved it on day 4 as straight forward as
I could. Duplicate code and everything! But not worth the effort
to make a nicer implementation. Save the time for harder problems.

Nice puzzle in which you really need to pay attention to details
when reading the description. After grasping the idea, the programming
was not so hard and integrating part 2 with part 1 worked like a 
charm. After some advent of codes in which defaultdict was really
a default in my solutions, here I could revisit it once more.
GPT4 can solve days 2 and 4, without a problem or extra input, 
it's getting crazy. Maybe it already pulls some fresh solutions from
the AoC reddit megathread or github repo's, than it is less magic, 
who knows, but I fear it comes up with its own magic ;-)
